# 📝 Item Management Application - IO Tech Task

Welcome to the **Item Management Application**! This is a simple React application that allows users to manage items. It includes features such as adding, editing, deleting, and sorting items. The app is built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring a clean and responsive design.

The application interacts with a **mock API** using [**JSONPlaceholder**](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), a free fake online REST API for testing and prototyping. This mock API simulates the backend for item management, so users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on items without needing a real server.
